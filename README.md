# Transformer for Financial Time Series Prediction 📈

This project implements a Transformer-based deep learning model for predicting financial time series trends (stocks, cryptocurrencies, gold prices, etc.).  
It is built using PyTorch Lightning and covers both theoretical background and practical implementation.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts behind Transformers.
- Apply deep learning techniques to real-world financial data.
- Develop a basic Transformer Encoder model for time series forecasting.
- Lay the groundwork for potential algorithmic trading applications.

## 📚 Contents
- Introduction to Transformers: Motivation, challenges of RNNs, attention mechanisms.
- Data Collection: Fetch stock market data using `yfinance` or from CSV files.
- Model Implementation: Build a Transformer Encoder from scratch.
- Training: Train the model using PyTorch Lightning, track experiments with Weights & Biases (W&B).
- Evaluation: Visualize predictions and analyze model performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies
