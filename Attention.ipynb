        "\n",
        "## Before Transformers: Sequence Modeling Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "Before the advent of Transformers, sequence modeling tasks primarily relied on recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, such as vanilla RNNs, LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units). These architectures were designed to process data sequentially, making them well-suited for tasks where temporal or sequential relationships are critical, such as language modeling, translation, and time-series analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strengths of RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs:**\n",
        "- Sequential Processing: RNNs inherently model temporal dependencies by processing input data token by token.\n",
        "- Memory Mechanisms: LSTMs and GRUs improve on standard RNNs by incorporating gating mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Challenges and Limitations:**\n",
        "- Sequential Computation: The sequential nature of RNNs makes training and inference slow, as tokens must be processed in order. This limits parallelization and scalability.\n",
        "- Long-Term Dependencies: Despite improvements, capturing very long-range dependencies remains challenging. Models often fail to effectively propagate information over extended sequences.\n",
        "- Gradient Issues: RNNs can suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, making it difficult to train deep models on long sequences.\n",
        "Fixed-Length Representations: Many traditional architectures compress variable-length sequences into fixed-size vectors, potentially losing important information.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Need for a Paradigm Shift:\n",
        "\n",
        "The limitations of RNN-based architectures inspired the search for alternatives capable of:\n",
        "- Parallelizing computation for faster training and inference.\n",
        "- Handling long-range dependencies efficiently.\n",
        "- Representing sequences in a more flexible and scalable manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "This led to the development of Transformers, which utilize self-attention mechanisms to address these challenges, transforming how sequence modeling is approached.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Attention: The Core of Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention, self-attention, and multi-head attention are central to the Transformer architecture. These mechanisms enable the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input, dynamically identifying important regions or tokens for a given task.\n",
        "- Self-Attention: Computes relationships between all tokens in the input, capturing both local and global dependencies effectively.\n",
        "- Multi-Head Attention: Extends self-attention by processing multiple subspaces simultaneously, allowing the model to focus on diverse aspects of the input (e.g., syntax, semantics).\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of Attention:\n",
        "- Processes tokens in parallel, enabling faster computation.\n",
        "- Captures long-range dependencies across the input.\n",
        "- Improves representational flexibility for complex relationships.\n",
        "Attention mechanisms form the backbone of the Transformer's ability to model sequences efficiently and effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The Transformer is a neural network architecture fundamentally built on attention mechanisms. It is structured as an **encoder-decoder** framework, with distinct roles for each component:\n",
        "- **Encoder:** Maps an input sequence of symbol representations $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ to a sequence of intermediate representations $(z_1, \\dots, z_n)$.  \n",
        "- **Decoder:** Takes the encoder's output $z$ and generates an output sequence $(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A key characteristic of the decoder is that it operates in an **auto-regressive** manner: at each time step, it uses the previously generated symbols as additional inputs to generate the next symbol in the sequence. This property ensures that the output is generated sequentially, preserving dependencies between tokens.\n",
        "\n",

        "# Positional Encoding\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers operate on sequences of data where the order of elements is critical. To illustrate the importance of order, consider the following example:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Vivre pour manger ≠ Manger pour vivre.\n",
        "\n",
        "In recurrent architectures such as RNNs, LSTMs, or GRUs, the sequential nature of processing inherently captures positional information, as tokens are processed in order. However, Transformers lack this sequential mechanism due to their parallelized processing of input sequences. This raises an important question:\n",
        "\n",
        "How can we encode the positional information of tokens within the Transformer architecture?\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution proposed by the authors of the Transformer model involves incorporating positional information directly into the input embeddings. This is achieved by adding a positional encoding vector to each token's embedding. These positional encodings effectively convey the position of each token within the sequence, enabling the model to understand the relative and absolute order of tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formally, the positional encoding for a token at position $pos$ and dimension $i$ is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}}}\\right)$$\n",

        "$$PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\\text{model}}}}\\right)$$\n",
